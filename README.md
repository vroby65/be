# be - Bash Line Editor

A simple Bash-based line-oriented text editor for terminal usage. This script allows editing and managing text files line-by-line with numbered entries, making it ideal for quick note-taking, list editing, or structured text manipulation.

## Features

- Load an existing text file (or start blank)
- View and edit lines by number
- Insert or remove specific lines
- Clear, renumber, or reset the buffer
- Save changes back to file
- Interactive shell with minimal commands

## Usage

```bash
./be [filename]
````

If no filename is provided, a new temporary buffer is used (named `blank`).
